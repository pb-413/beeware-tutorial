Didn't include any code changes, so taking a not here.

`briefcase create` creates application scaffolding to support the packaging process.
- Generated application template
- Dowloads and installs supporting packages
- Installs app requirements
- Installed your app code
- Installed your resources (icons, etc.)

`briefcase build` creates the exe after compilation and metadata updates.

`briefcase run` will run that exe instead of running python / dev environment.

`briefcase package` will turn that into an msi.
